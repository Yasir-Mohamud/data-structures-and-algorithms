# StacksAndQueues
This Data Structure demonstrates how a Stack and a Queue are constructed.

## Challenge
1. Can successfully push onto a stack
1. Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
1. Can successfully pop off the stack
1. Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
1. Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
1. Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
1. Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
1. Can successfully enqueue into a queue
1. Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
1. Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
1. Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
1. Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
1. Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
1. Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception

## Approach & Efficiency
- Stack.Push() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)
- Stack.Peek() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)
- Stack.Pop() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)
- Queue.Enqueue() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)
- Queue.Peek() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)
- Queue.Dequeue() Time: O(1) | Space: O(1)


## API
- Stack.Push() - Adds a new `node` on top of the stack.
- Stack.Peek() - Returns the value of the `top node`.
- Stack.Pop() - Removes and returns the value of the `top node`.
- Queue.Enqueue() - Adds a new `node` to the `front` of the queue.
- Queue.Peek() - Returns the value of the `front` node.
- Queue.Dequeue() - Removes and returns value of the `front` node.
- IsEmpty() - Returns boolean if `stack/queue` is empty.
