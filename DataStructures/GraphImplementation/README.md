# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Graph is a non-Linear data structure that can be seen at as a collection of
vertices(Nodes) connected by edges(line segments that connects 2 nodes).
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Implementation of a Graph
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- BreadthFirst 
Time : O(V(vertex) + E(edges))
Space : 0(V(vertecies))
## Visuals
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
1. Breadth First
